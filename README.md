## Technologies Used:
- [Forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/docs/v2): Where the weather data comes from.
- [Google Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro): Allows me to convert a name of a place into coordinates and vice-versa.
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/): A structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.
